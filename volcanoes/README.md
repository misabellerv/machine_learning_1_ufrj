In this project we are using very basic concepts of Machine learning: Supervised learning and classification (binary and multiclass). 
Databases used are from Magellan, a NASA probe that takes pictures of the surface of Venus. The images are very noisy, but we can still get some useful information from them: whether or not there is a volcano, their radius, how many volcanoes, and the type of image classification.
Pre-processing were made to try to denoise images with sckit-image and predictions were made with sckit-learn. Cross-validation were used training classifiers.
